**KD&Company** is a mock IT services company designed to demonstrate a modern and interactive website for showcasing various technology services. This project was created as part of a personal initiative to simulate a real-world business website for an IT firm, providing an opportunity to explore the full-stack development process.

The website includes features such as:

- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Service Showcase**: A detailed list of services that an IT company might offer, including web development, mobile app development, cybersecurity solutions, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: The website is built using React.js for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- **Backend Functionality**: The project integrates a Node.js backend with Express.js, making it possible to simulate data handling for the services and user inquiries.
- **Cloud and Database**: It uses cloud services and databases (such as MongoDB and MySQL) to demonstrate how scalable, real-world applications work.
- **Deployment Ready**: The project can be easily deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, ensuring high availability and scalability.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world IT services website, helping users better understand the capabilities of full-stack web development while providing a modern, functional mock-up for IT service businesses.
